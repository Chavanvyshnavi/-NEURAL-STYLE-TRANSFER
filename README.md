description:
The objective of this task was to implement a simple Neural Style Transfer (NST) model that applies the artistic style of one image (the style image) to another image (the content image) to produce a visually stylized output. The approach used in this implementation is a beginner-friendly method that blends the content and style images using Pythonâ€™s Pillow library. The content image represents the photograph to be transformed, while the style image provides the artistic patterns. The script resizes the style image to match the content image dimensions and performs a weighted blend, giving 60% importance to the content and 40% to the style. The resulting image, saved as output.jpg, demonstrates the combined features of both input images, providing a stylized version suitable for submission. This task highlights the basic principles of neural style transfer and image manipulation, and serves as a practical introduction to working with images and Python-based image processing libraries.
